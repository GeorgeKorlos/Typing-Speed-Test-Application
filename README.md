# Typing Speed Test Application

This project is part of **Angela Yu's 100 Days of Code** course. It is a graphical user interface (GUI) application built with **Python** and **Tkinter** that allows users to measure their typing speed in **words per minute (WPM)**.

## Features:
- Displays a sample text for typing.
- Provides a button to start the typing test.
- Calculates typing speed in words per minute (WPM).
- Displays the result after submission.

## How to Use:
1. **Start Test:** Click the "Start" button to begin the test. The text area will clear, and the timer will begin.
2. **Type the Sample Text:** Type the sample text displayed at the top as quickly and accurately as you can.
3. **Submit:** Click the "Submit" button to calculate your typing speed in words per minute (WPM).
4. **View Result:** Your WPM will be displayed at the bottom of the window.

## Requirements:
- **Python 3.x**
- **Tkinter** (usually comes pre-installed with Python)

## Running the Application:
To run the application, execute the following command in your terminal:

```bash
python typing_speed_app.py
```
This will launch the typing speed test window where you can start testing your typing speed.
